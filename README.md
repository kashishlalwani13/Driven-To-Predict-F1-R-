# Driven-To-Predict-F1-R-
This R‑based project analyzes Formula 1 data (2019–2024). Key tools and packages include dplyr, ggplot2, xgboost, cluster, and binom. The repository contains all R scripts (and/or RMarkdown), the final PDF report, and the raw CSV datasets needed to reproduce every analysis and visualization.
